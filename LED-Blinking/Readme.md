# OBJECTIVES: 
   The aim of the experiment is to make 
   (A) the built-in LED of the Arduino and 
   (B) An external LED to blink. 
   
# COMPONENTS REQUIRED:
  - Arduino UNO
  - LED
  - Resistor
  - Breadboard
  - Wires
    
# ALGORITHM: (A)
  1. Start 
  2. Set up the pin 13 as output 
  3. Start the infinite loop 
  4. Turn the LED on by setting the voltage level to HIGH using digitalWrite function. 
  5. Wait for one second using delay function. 
  6. Turn the LED off by setting the voltage level to LOW using digitalWrite function. 
  7. Wait for one second using delay function. 
  8. End

# ALGORITHM: (B)
  1. Start 
  2. Set up the pin 9 as output 
  3. Start the infinite loop 
  4. Turn the LED on by setting the voltage level to HIGH using digitalWrite function. 
  5. Wait for one second using delay function. 
  6. Turn the LED off by setting the voltage level to LOW using digitalWrite function. 
  7. Wait for one second using delay function. 
  8. End
