This repository contains simple Internet of Things (IoT) beginner projects using **Tinkercad** and **Wokwi** simulators. Each folder contains Arduino code, simulation links, and basic circuit info.


# How to Simulate in Tinkercad
  1. Go to https://www.tinkercad.com/
  2. Log in or create an account
  3. Click “Circuits” → “Create new Circuit”
  4. Drag components in the respected Readme.md file
  5. Connect the components as per the connection diagram
# Method - 1 : Code
  6. Click on “Code” and choose Text mode
